# Anthor Test - Back-end

1. Before starting the project, create a github repo and make an initial commit only with
a Readme file, answering the following questions:
2. How do you intend to approach this project? What technologies have you
decided to use for each part?
3. Do you find this to be particularly challenging in any of its requirements?
4. If you had a lot of time to do this, what would you do differently?
